# Mid-term assignment for "Advanced topics in reinforcement learning" - 048716

The project is structured as follows:

Each domain is in it's own directory (TAXI / Acrobot). The TAXI domain is split into PolicyGradient (A2C) and DQN, where in the DQN we have the default *HW 1 - DQN.ipynb*, we have a parameter sweep file for L1 norm and dropout *HW 1 - DQN - Param Sweep.ipynb* and we have a file for the alternative encoding we suggested *HW 1 - DQN - Alternative Encoding.ipynb*.

**All files are self-contained as iPython notebooks and do not require imports other than python libraries (e.g. torch, matplotlib, etc..).**
